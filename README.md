# COMP3000 / Nursing Home Management System
# Project Vison
In the future, aging will become a problem that many countries need to face. For example, in China, the scale of nursing homes has increased year by year, and investment and policies have also gradually increased. The increase in the number of nursing homes requires a corresponding management system to improve the management of the elderly. The system can record the elderly information, physical disease registration, physical health monitoring, daily food collocation, nursing worker management, consumption management and so on. Then, through daily data analysis, a model diagram is formed and provided to the person in charge of the nursing home to control costs and improve efficiency.
